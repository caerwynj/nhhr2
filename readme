An introduction to the Qserver.

Start the Qserver with the command:
Qserver &
The Qserver then resides in memory waiting to be programmed in order
to start sessions with remote databases.

To program the Qserver start it's shell with the command:
qsh
You will then see the prompt 'Q>' displayed at which point you can
enter any Tcl command which will be sent to the Qserver and interpreted.
To exit from the shell type ctrl-C

Six additional commands have been supplied with the Qserver in order to
handle sessions. These are:
* qserver_init  [max number of databases]
* new_db [DatabaseName]
* open_session [DatabaseName] [Login parameters]
* close_session [DatabaseName]
* delete_db [DatabaseName]
* session_info
* q_restart [Restart script]

qserver_init must be called once when the Qserver is first started and should
only be called once. It must be called before any other commands. 
Its argument is the maximum number of databases that
will be handled by the Qserver (eg. 3 - for pas, radis, path).

new_db creates the queue for a database and must be called before any
open_session commands for the same database. It should only be called once
for each database. The argument is the name of the database.

open_session creates a new session for a database and can be called as many
times as you wish but only after the new_db command has been called for
the same database.

close_session closes a session for a particular database. The argument
is the name of the database. It can be called as many times until all
the sessions on a database have been killed.

delete_db closes all sessions for a database and removes the queue for the
database. 

session_info returns information about all current databases and the number 
and state of all sessions for each database.
